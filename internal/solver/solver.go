// Present a challenge to the solver. The Challenge Request comes from
// cert-manager through the webhook integration. Once presented with a challenge,
// a DNS Record needs to be created with the challenge information so cert-manager
// can assert that the domain is owned by user of Phonebook.
//
// The DNSRecord created for a challenge will have a generic "challenge" label
// added to it. This will allow cleanup operations to get a list of all challenges
// and remove those that needs to be cleaned up. Now, in an ideal world, the label
// would have been specific enough so cleanup duties would be able to retrieve only
// the proper challenge records. For example, the label could hold the ResolvedFQDN and
// the cleanup could retrieve DNS Records by ResolvedFQDN. It is, however, impossible
// to implement safely as Labels have a stricter validation set(1) compared to FQDN(2).
//
// The tradeoff is to label challenges and do client-side filtering inside the CleanUp
// method instead. It is reasonable to think that the number of challenges at any given
// time is pretty low, the bandwidth/CPU to filter those records on the client side seems
// acceptable at this time.
