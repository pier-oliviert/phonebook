                    the same Zone (ie. Split-Horizon DNS).

                    In most cases, this field isn't necessary as the Zone field should be enough
                    to let Phonebook find the proper Provider. This field only gives a hint to Phonebook
                    and the Zones has to match as well.

                    it can be an IP address or some text value.
                    The reason why targets is plural is because some provider support multiple values for
                    a given record types. For most cases, it's expected to only have 1 value.

                    TTL is the Time To Live for the record. It represents the time
                    in seconds that the record is cached by resolvers.

                    "mydomain.com" would be your zone.

                    The Zone needs to find a match in one of the DNSProvider configured in your
                    cluster. Unless the optional `Provider` field is set, Phonebook will look
                    at all the providers configured to try to find a match for the zone.

                    If no provider matches the zone, the record won't be created.

                          ConditionError. This field is optional and should be used to give additionnal context.
                          Since this value can be overriden by future changes to the status of the condition,
                          users might want to also record the Reason through Kubernete's EventRecorder.

                    RemoteInfo is a field that can be used by DNSIntegration's provider to
                    store information as the Record is created. Each integration has its own map it can
                    populate with arbitrary data. Each entries in the root RemoteInfo refers to the name of
                    the integration that stored the intormation. For instance, if you have a DNSRecord that
                    is shared between 2 integrations named `cloudflare-dev` and `aws-prod`, RemoteInfo would
                    look like this:
                       map[string]map[string]string{
                         "cloudflare-dev": map[string]string{

                         }
                       }

                    A DNSIntegration can have multiple entries stored in this field and it's up the integration
                    to make sure those fields are not stale.
